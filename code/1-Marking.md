## Marking

Your project will be assessed under 3 criteria, all given 33% weighting.

1. An objective and subjective mark will be given for task 1 based on the improvements you make
2. An objective mark for task 2 based on the code working and test coverage
3. A subjective mark for a technical interview (given a good score in 1 and 2)
