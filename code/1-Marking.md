## Marking

Your project will be assessed under 3 criteria, all given 33% weighting.

1. An objective and subjective mark will be given for task 1 based on the changes made
2. An objective mark for task 2 based on the code working and test coverage
3. If your score in 1 & 2 was above 50%, you'll be invited to a technical interview which will have another 33% mark

**Note:** To appreciate your time taking this test, we'll inform you of the outcome regardless.
